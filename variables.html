        <h2>INTANGIBLE ASSETS</h2>
        <p>It is an asset that is not physical in nature, such as goodwill, brand recognition, and intellectual property— patents, trademarks, and copyrights. These items are in opposition to tangible assets that have physical substance, such as land, vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Although intangible assets lack the apparent physical worth of a factory 32 or equipment, they can also be advantageous for a company and play a crucial role in determining its future success or downfalls (Kenton, 2022).</p>
        
        <h3>The Positive and Negative Aspects of Intangible Assets:</h3>
        <table class="aspects-table">

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Intangible assets contribute significantly to the value of a company. As the entire world increasingly becomes an interconnected community, the value of intangible assets such as intellectual property, knowledge, and business networks rises.</td>
                    <td>The valuation of intangible assets is a challenging procedure that necessitates an in-depth knowledge of the different techniques, approaches, and assessments. Frequently, owners and growing businesses lack the required abilities, expertise, and funding to carry out these duties and thus, require the assistance of a business analyst or accountant that may charge excessive fees that the business involved may be incapable to afford in the beginning phases.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Intangible assets that are visible to the public can be extremely beneficial for organizations seeking ways to distinguish themselves from competitors. Strong brands, distinctive technologies, or unique intellectual property rights can all help a company boost its commercial appeal, attract prospective consumers, and establish a loyal customer base.</td>
                    <td>Intangible assets are prone to infringements by other businesses, which may diminish their value and compel corporations to commit large resources in lawsuits to safeguard them.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Having intangible assets are capable of significantly improving a company's perceived worth and stability, which impresses investors or shareholders that may result in higher financing or an advantageous appraisal.</td>
                    <td>Intangible assets, which include copyrights and intellectual property, possess a limited useful life and undetermined future worth.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Intangible assets, compared to tangible ones, can be traded or licensed to third parties more easily, allowing firms more versatility and the opportunity to diversify into new markets and lines of products.</td>
                    <td>Intangible assets, as opposed to physical assets, may have minimal collateral value, resulting in it being less feasible for enterprises to obtain funding depending on their value.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Patents and copyrights, for instance, may encourage innovation by safeguarding businesses' and individuals' ideas and discoveries, giving an incentive for ongoing investment in advancement of knowledge.</td>

        <h2>CAPITAL STRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>The capital structure of a company pertains to how it acquires financial resources for its activities and expansion through diverse funding sources like issuing bonds, long-term notes payable, ordinary shares, preferred shares, or retained earnings. It is also known as “financial leverage” and determining the ideal proportion of debt and equity financing is a crucial aspect that every business needs to consider for its smooth operation. Furthermore, financial organizations, including banks and other lending institutions, evaluate the hazards of assisting a company in funding its activities. Hence, in cases where a company seems to have a high degree of leverage, meaning it has considerably more debt than equity, the risk is greater because the company owes more than it earns (Miller, 2019).</p>
